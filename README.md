# 🙏 Apology

Let me offer a few apologies in advance.

## 📘 About English

We don’t aim for perfect or strictly correct English grammar.

In addition to the United Kingdom, countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia also use English as an official language.
Furthermore, there are countries like India, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines where English is widely used as a common language.

Apologies to those from other regions — we mainly follow American English.

We’re not native speakers, so as long as the meaning comes across clearly, that’s good enough for us.

## 🌍 UTF-8 Only

Officially, only UTF-8 is supported.
However, other encodings may also work, depending on PHP’s specifications.

## ❌ Microsoft Windows Products Not Supported

We do not officially support Microsoft Windows products.
This is to maintain clean and consistent source code.
However, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) will likely work.
